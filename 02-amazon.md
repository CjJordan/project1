# Amazon

#### Difficulty: 2

Your job is to create a clone of Amazon. The design and functionality should match Amazon exactly. This is not the time to get creative. This is the time to show off your ability to match design and project specs. 


# Project Requirements

Each member must own 1 user story (except the lead engineer). That member of the team is solely responsible for the functionality of that feature and will be graded predominantly on that features success.

Each member must participate in a daily scrum (every day including weekends unless religious beliefs prevent them from doing so). 

All projects must match the color scheme, fonts (as closely as possible), and layout of the assigned website.

All projects must include a mobile layout in addition to a desktop layout. 

Projects are *not* required to include secure login. 

Projects must include a README markdown file with detailed documentation. 

Project repos must have a protected master branch and require code review before merge.

All files must use JSDoc style documentation. 


# MVP

Your MVP includes the following functionality. Your project is not complete until all of the below features are working:

1. Users can search inventory. 
2. Users can purchase inventory, decrement the inventory count, and increase their total cost
3. Sellers can log in to see purchases and manage inventory

# Additional Functionality

If you have a 5th teammate, you must complete one of the features listed below. If you complete the above functionality early, you may select additional functionality from the list below, or you may choose your own feature to add. 

1. Users can search by department
2. Users can add reviews
3. Users can sign in and see past orders

# Lead Engineer

Every team must have a lead engineer (unless an instructional staff member is acting as your team's lead). The lead engineer is ultimately responsible for the success of the entire application. The lead has several responsibilities:

1. Architect the application using a components diagram. 
2. Create all database models.
3. Seed the database if needed.
4. Set up a get, post, put, and delete route for all resources.
5. Create the basic stylesheet for the application (grid, color, font, graphic assets).
6. Act as scrum master. 
7. Report to team TA daily. 
8. Pair with teammates as needed.
9. Set up and configure GitHub repo.
10. Manage deployment.
